Letter-Recognizer-On-Neurons by BaronVladziu

This is simple application that is able to learn to recognize letter, numbers and every other sign
from ASCII chart between nr 33 and 126. It's using two layers of artificial neurons.
(Only two so it's not terribly slow while learning.)

Libraries used:
 - SFML

How to use:
 - Draw something on a black window
 - Press Enter (Return)
 - Tell the app what you've drawn (write it in command window)
 - Watch it learn (and repeat)

Frankly, I'm not entirely sure it works correctly XD
